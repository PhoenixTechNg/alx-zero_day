My first readme
I have done some more awesome things with this project, to ensure effective collaboration i create a new branch called "update_script"
I ensure the code in the new branch was good enough and i update it to the origin or upstream branch called "main" using the (git push -u origin main) command
Later i will merge the twi branches together
